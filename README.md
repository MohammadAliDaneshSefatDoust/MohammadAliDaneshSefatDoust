### 👋Hi there 
This is my Github page

💗I do like programming, & I like to share my ideas with others. My vision is to touch, inspire and influence; through our ideas, services and products to make the world a better place, pixel by pixel, line of code by line of code, experience by experience. With passion!🙏

💻I am interested in the development of artificial intelligence in the field of electronic engineering and medicine
